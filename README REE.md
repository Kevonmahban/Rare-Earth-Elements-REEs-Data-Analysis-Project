Rare Earth Elements (REE) Data Analysis Project
===============================================

Project Overview
----------------
This project was developed for the U.S. Department of Commerce – Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) office. It focuses on the analysis of Rare Earth Elements (REEs), with a particular emphasis on Neodymium (Nd), to support strategic planning and congressional oversight related to supply chain risks.

The analysis is divided into multiple parts covering domestic production, global valuation, non-spatial resource analysis, inferential statistics, and predictive modeling of site viability and risk.

Repository Contents
-------------------
- `Part I USGS REE US Data Analysis.ipynb` – U.S. production-focused analysis based on the USGS dataset.
- `Part II Global REE Projects Value Analysis.ipynb` – Global REE valuation and scaled value calculations.
- `Part III Non-Spatial REE Analysis.ipynb` – Analysis of non-spatial REE occurrences with GDP and population data.
- `Part IV Statistical Analysis.ipynb` – Chi-squared tests and GDP correlation with REE site data.
- `Part V Predictive Modeling.ipynb` – Machine learning models predicting REE site risk and financial viability.

Project Objectives
------------------
- Evaluate the distribution and accessibility of REEs in U.S. mining data.
- Assess the economic value of REE deposits globally.
- Identify REE mineral presence in unexplored and active locations.
- Use statistical methods to explore patterns across regions.
- Develop predictive models to estimate risk and viability of REE mining projects.

Key Topics Covered
------------------

### Part I – USGS REE U.S. Production Analysis
- Production trends for domestic REEs.
- Most accessible and abundant REEs in the U.S.
- Bar charts and descriptive stats of production data.

### Part II – Global REE Projects Value Analysis
- Calculation of Total Scaled Value using REE oxide percentages and pricing.
- Identification of most valuable REE projects and regions.
- Analysis of economic implications for sourcing Neodymium and other key REEs.

### Part III – Non-Spatial REE Global Analysis
- Mapping REE mineral occurrences by country.
- Merging of GDP and population statistics to explore strategic partnerships.
- Highlighting of countries with undeveloped REE potential.

### Part IV – Statistical Analysis
- Chi-squared test of REE vs. Non-REE site distribution across continents.
- Correlation analysis between REE valuation and GDP.

### Part V – Predictive Modeling
- K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest models for predicting mining site risk.
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, and precision.
- Risk prediction for five new potential REE sites.
